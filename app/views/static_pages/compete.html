            <p>As an interdepartmental competition, each group will work to duct tape one member of their team to a wall as quickly as possible. Members will have to answer trivia questions in order to receive more tape, as each group will only be given a limited initial amount. Snacks will be provided and there will be people stuck on walls so be sure to stop by!</p>
